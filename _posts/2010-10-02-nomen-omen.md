We decided to name the boat *Super Chicken* because I got a rubber chicken and named it *Super Chicken*. Then we discovered that there was a short-running cartoon about a rich chicken called *Henry Cabot Henhouse III* and his sidekick *Fred* who is a lion and they fight crime together in many stupid ways. *Super Chicken* has the world's most annoying heroic cry that everyone hates sooooooooooooooooooooooo very much.
