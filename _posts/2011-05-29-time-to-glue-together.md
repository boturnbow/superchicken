5/29/11 today we (as in mostly my dad) epoxied the port side of the bout after we did the starboard side (port:left and starboard:right looking down the bow) and it goes neat epoxy, epoxy jell, cloth, neat epoxy, and then cloth. The job i did was just cutting the cloth so that is the end of my post so good buy.
