To any spectator on land, the seaside scene outside Henry Cabot Henhouse's lodge would look perfectly normal.  Diving underwater, however, one might see an aquatic racecar emblazoned "Thunderbolt Grease Slapper" fleeing from an enormous sub sandwich.  It is within this Sub Sandwich Submarine that we rejoin our hero, Super Chicken!

"He's getting away from us!" shouts Fred, anxiously gnawing on Super Chicken's wing.

"Let go of my arm, would you?" replies Super Chicken.  "I'm shifting into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE!"

And the sub shoots through the water toward Tom Slick.  In fact, it rear-ends the Grease Slapper in its burst of speed, totaling both vehicles.
