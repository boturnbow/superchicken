We reunite with our hero, Super Chicken, lounging on the porch of his lakeside mansion drinking teriyaki punch. All is good and well until Fred the Lion notices a strange blemish on the watery horizon. "Super Chicken! I think I just saw a sea monster!" Fred shrieks.

"Please, Fred," Super Chicken clucks. "Call me Henry when I'm not on the sauce. Now what were you saying about a sea monster?"

"I just saw one out on the lake! Look-- there it is again!" Fred says, pointing to a gray oval rising slowly from the lake.

"Egads!" cries Super Chicken. "That's no sea monster.... That's Tom Slick! Quickly, Fred, get me the sauce!"

To be continued......
